			<h1>Artist's Philosophy</h1>
			<p>I believe that our clients will be happy with their artwork today and for a lifetime. Tattoos are more than just ink on your skin at Red-Ink Tattoo , it is my belief that a tattoo is an artistic expression of who you are. Every individual has his own experience that he/she wanted to put in skin as a memory,as a work of art. And I love to be a part of that experience.</p>

			<h2>For the Client<h2>
			<p>We whole heartedly believe that a tattoo is not only about the finished product, but rather a combination of a good connection with your artist, a welcoming friendly environment, and a room full of shared laughter and experience. 

			We are grateful for compliments about our work, but we are touched by the depth to which clients open up and share and create memories and conversation. It makes our jobs and lives that much more meaningful.</p>
